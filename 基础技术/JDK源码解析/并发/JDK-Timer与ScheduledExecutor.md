## 1：JDK Timer（使用案例如HashedWheelTime）
java.util.Timer是一个单线程的定时器，定时调度所拥有的TimerTask任务,TimerTask类是一个定时任务类，实现了Runnable接口，并且是一个抽象类，需要定时执行的任务都需要重写他的run方法
###### 1：构建一个定时器
```java
   public Timer() {
        this("Timer-" + serialNumber());
    }

    /**
     * Creates a new timer whose associated thread may be specified to
     * {@linkplain Thread#setDaemon run as a daemon}.
     * A daemon thread is called for if the timer will be used to
     * schedule repeating "maintenance activities", which must be
     * performed as long as the application is running, but should not
     * prolong the lifetime of the application.
     *
     * @param isDaemon true if the associated thread should run as a daemon.
     */
    public Timer(boolean isDaemon) {
        this("Timer-" + serialNumber(), isDaemon);
    }

    /**
     * Creates a new timer whose associated thread has the specified name.
     * The associated thread does <i>not</i>
     * {@linkplain Thread#setDaemon run as a daemon}.
     *
     * @param name the name of the associated thread
     * @throws NullPointerException if {@code name} is null
     * @since 1.5
     */
    public Timer(String name) {
        thread.setName(name);
        thread.start();
    }

    /**
     * Creates a new timer whose associated thread has the specified name,
     * and may be specified to
     * {@linkplain Thread#setDaemon run as a daemon}.
     *
     * @param name the name of the associated thread
     * @param isDaemon true if the associated thread should run as a daemon
     * @throws NullPointerException if {@code name} is null
     * @since 1.5
     */
    public Timer(String name, boolean isDaemon) {
        thread.setName(name);
        thread.setDaemon(isDaemon);
        thread.start();
    }
    
```

###### 3:schedul()与scheduleAtFixedRate()

两者功能相似，但schedule（）更注重保持时间间隔的稳定，保证每隔period的时间可调用一次。而scheduleAtFixRate更注重保持执行频率的稳定，保证多次调用的时间趋近于period的时间，如果执行任务的时间大于period的时间，就会在任务执行完马上执行下一次任务。

###### 4：Timer类的缺陷
时间不准确延迟：由于Timer在执行任务的时候是单线程的，如果存在多个任务，某个任务耗时过长，就会导致任务时间延迟，即使是周期执行的，也会影响下一个周期。

异常终止：如果抛出未捕获的异常，那么就会导致Timer线程终止，还会终止所有的任务，而且Timer不会重新恢复线程后再执行。

执行周期任务依赖系统时间，由于Timer执行周期依赖于系统时间，所以如果当前系统时间出现了变化，则会出现一些执行上的变化。
## 2：scheduledExecutor（在Sentinel中大量使用，如熔断以及warmup模式的限流）
  基于线程池设计的SceduledExecutor，就是改成了多线程的方式，任务并发执行，相互之间不会受到干扰。
  
     具体实现类为ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor，这是一个ExecutorService线程池，除了具有线程池的基本功能，还具有定时以及周期执行任务的功能，常用作定时任务。

        sft.outerTask = t;
        delayedExecute(t);
        return t;
    }

```
## 两者的一个对比
    1：ScheduledExecutor可以解决Timer的不准确延迟问题，因为内部是线程池实现的，可以并发执行，互相之间不受影响
    
    2：由于是ScheduledExecutor并发执行，可以起到很好的线程隔离，即使产生异常，也不会导致其他任务受到影响。
    
    3：ScheduledExecutor执行的周期任务，如果在执行过程中发生异常，则会终止，不会影响其他任务，而且不会周期性执行。所以，使用过程中尽可能的捕获一切异常。
     
 ## 思考
 ###### 结合你所看到的上述两个方法的实际应用思考一下何为这样做。描述其使用场景。
